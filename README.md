## üöÄ Expertise

Passionate about designing intuitive, accessible user experiences, I specialize in **interface design**, **design systems**, and **web implementation workflows**.  
My approach blends aesthetics with performance, rooted in user needs and technical feasibility.

I've worked across fast-paced teams, collaborated with engineers to translate designs into robust code, and led design initiatives that balanced creativity with consistency.

In addition to design leadership, I enjoy experimenting with **no-code tools like Webflow**, building and publishing **static websites**, and sharing my process with peers.
